AI Assignment: Yoga-Themed Proof of Concept

Objective
Develop an AI-powered feature that enhances the yoga experience through personalization, 
feedback, or innovative functionalities. This assignment is intended to evaluate your AI skills, 
problem-solving abilities, and creativity in building solutions relevant to the wellness domain.

Requirements
1. Select a Use Case:
Choose one of the following yoga-related use cases to build your proof of concept (PoC):
o Pose Detection & Correction: Create a model to identify yoga poses and provide 
feedback for alignment and accuracy.
o Breathing Pattern Analysis: Develop a tool that uses audio input or other signals 
to analyze breathing patterns during yoga.
o Mood-Based Session Recommendation: Use sentiment analysis to suggest yoga 
routines based on the user's mood (derived from text, voice, or other data).
o Personalized Wellness Insights: Generate personalized reports based on user 
data like pose proficiency, session duration, or engagement.

3. Data Selection:
o Use publicly available datasets or generate synthetic data for your PoC.
o Ensure the data is relevant to the chosen use case.
4. Model Development:
o Train a machine learning or deep learning model suitable for the selected use 
case.
o Clearly outline your modelâ€™s architecture and decision-making process.
o Optimize the model for accuracy, efficiency, or real-time application, depending 
on the feature.

6. Integration with a Yoga App (Optional):
o Simulate how your AI feature could be integrated into a yoga app by creating a 
mock API or demonstrating a simple interface.
Key Areas to Focus On
1. Problem Understanding & Creativity:
o Clearly articulate the problem you're solving and your innovative approach.
2. Model Performance:
o Demonstrate the effectiveness of your model through metrics or visualizations.
3. User-Centric Application:
o Ensure the feature aligns with the needs of yoga practitioners and enhances their 
experience.
4. Scalability:
o Highlight how your feature could scale for diverse users and data.
